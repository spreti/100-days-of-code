# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 10: Jan 17th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Began my personal portfolio page today- Hooray! 
**Thoughts**: oh the endless ideas! - spending the rest of my day getting more familiar with bootstrap grids- I havent given up on this! Running into snags getting my columns to float so for example:

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">col-md-4</div>
    <div class="col-md-8">col-md-8</div>
         </div>
  </div>
codepen has both col-md-4 as well as col-md-8 display as each their own row versus floating together in one row. My CSS has both their height the same and no obstructing attributes like specific widths. erg.

### Day 9: Jan 16th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished with my Tribute page!! While I think I could go another 18 years of trying things out, it is sufficient for what I envisioned. 
**Thoughts**: I actually ended up removing alot of my CSS/ Erased and rewrote quite a bit of code. As well I decided not to work with the bootstrap grid as I was running into so many snags there. My tribute page is not near as responsive as I would like it to be however I did format the layout with percentages and as well tried to make sure all widths were the same in regards to imagimg as to provide a clean vertical line. 

I need more work with div and layouts. I'll be practicing this as well as continuing to build up my bootstrap grid skills in the next few days.

### Day 8: Jan 15th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: So I definitely am not done with my tribute page, but I did get quite a bit more practice today with bootstrap! My hour of code went as follows: type code, run code, erase code:repeat. 
**Thoughts**: Still frustruated with alignment and layout as it's not quite what I want. I know I'm being knit-picky buuuut  errrggg.

### Day 7: Jan 14th,2018

**Today's Progress**: My Tribute page is looking much more like what I picture in my mind! I took some time to go over a module in pluralsight today prior to working on the page, I think my understanding of the Bootstrap grid is much more concrete than in prior days and that alone helped to negate a lot of frustration with alignment and layout. 
**Thoughts** Again- still feeling like I need more time with Bootstrap, although I will say that I am enjoying what I have so far been able to learn and put to practice. Also I know that I am still overcomplicating things. I ran into a snag that took me almost 45 minutes wrap my head around- getting my header image to fill the width of the .container-fluid. My solution came through trial and error and re-running my code (erg) It's still not what I want it to be, but I think the rest of the space may be due to flow as I do not have any content yet in my aside column? I'll be taking this question to the 100 days slack board as I'm stumped. Anyways the closest I got to seeing the visual result of what I imagined was by removing a lot of my CSS. Like I said Im overcomplicating. So, the Tribute page did not get finished today, but it's about the progress right?

**Today's Progress**: Did some more work today on my Tribute page, about an hour and a half....Hey its Saturday :)

**Thoughts** I still feel I need to gain more familiarity with Bootstrap, Im still struggling with dimmensioning especially for grids written with HTML and CSS. I did refer to gridbyexample.com which I find to be a fantastic resource, but I am still running into snags. I am hoping to finailze my tribute page tomorrow.

### Day 5: Jan 12th,2018

**Today's Progress**: I could have sworn I updated this yesterday- maybe I forgot to commit changes? Anywho, Began my Tribute page for FCC through Codepen. Ran into a lot of snags in overanalyzing whether or not to use Bootstrap or to use HTML and CSS especially in the Grid area. 

**Thoughts** I need more Bootstrap practice!! I feel like I'm really overcomplicating things with trying to mix CSS as well as Bootstrap. I also need to revisit the natural flow of a webpage.

### Day 4: Jan 11th,2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the remaining Bootstrap challenges on Freecode Camp as well as the JQuery challenges ending at challenge number 110 in my map. 

**Thoughts** Im currently really loving web development! While it has its ups and downs as with anything, I feel that I've learned more in the past 3 months than in my last year, and while I had intended to learn Javascript prior to taking on anything else the freecode camp map took me elsewhere (totally not a bad thing). Confident wouldn't be the word I would use to describe my knowledge base of JQuery, as similar to my feelings towards Bootstrap, It also wasn't as scary as I thought it'd be but I do feel like I need a lot more practice and exposure to functions- Off to study some more!

### Day 3: Jan 10th,2018

**Today's Progress**: I completed about 20 bootstrap challenges today through free code camp. Wasn't I just saying that I needed more practice with forms and buttons?

**Thoughts** So turns out Bootstrap is not so scary. As well my past two days of "thoughts comments" seem a little silly in hindsight, but probably not as silly as the idea that I wasn't planning on putting too much effort into learning frameworks ... which I will openly admit that I didn't realize thats what bootstrap was. Furthermore, I heard on a coding podcast not so long ago an opinionated guy talk about the overuse of frameworks in the coding community and had decided that I would not be learning them as I strive to learn the "real" way of doing things. Anyways my point is, It was small potatoes in comparsion to teaching myself viewport units, and now I have the knowledge of manually coding a responsive website ( I mean to the extent that I will get with html and css) and now I've been exposed to the quick way. ie. bootstrap.  Zig zagged learning is a real thing, especially when you're self taught.

### Day 2: Jan 9th,2018

**Today's Progress**: 40 coding challenges in 1 hour! Although it is html5 and CSS both languges that I have learned over the past 6 months I am feeling pretty good about it and will consider it a win! 

**Thoughts** I need to practice forms. I realized the bulk of my studying so far has been pretty basic tags for html and as well a lot of work with div, and furthermore formatting to the viewport in regards to styling with CSS. When I came across tags for forms such as radio buttons and form actions this was a bit unfamiliar to me. Ended on challenge number 61. So begins bootstrap challenges tomorrow, eek! scary as I have not previewed bootstrap so far however,I guess I've gotta start somewhere.

### Day 1: Jan 8th,2018

**Today's Progress**: I started Javascript today, and coded my first ever script "Hello World" as an alert on one of my practice sites I had coded locally in the past via Adobe Brackets. I also completed html5 and CSS challenges in freecodecamp. Although I already have prior self taught knowledge of html5 as well as CSS, I figured it best to complete the challenges in free code camp anyways in the case that theres some new information in there for me. I plan to work ahead as so that my 100 days of code challenge more accurately represents my knowledge base (meaning what will be reflected in this log will soon be more coding challenges for Javascript and eventually Jquery as these two languages are what I am currently learning) 

**Thoughts** Its my first day of Javascript coding.Simple and beginner as it may be I ran my first script it, and it worked! I also spent a total of 5 hours studying specifically Javascript today. Ended on challenge number 21.
