# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 27: Feb 4th, 2018
**Today's Progress**: worked more on codepen today- went through my css, added what will hopefully be a semi interactive calendar that will more so provide as an example and worked with floats and clearning to ensure the layout I am thinking of. 
**Thoughts**:

### Day 25: Feb 2nd, 2018
**Today's Progress**: went back through my codepen and revised some css as well as the Javascript I wrote, what I am trying to do is take the input from the html form assign it to variables and then perform mathematical functions with it like an insurance calculator. I definitely know I am not calling the input correctly but I do think I did nail down my function and reassignment into a bill total variable correctly today (whoop!) 
**Thoughts**:Yay Javascript!

### Day 24: Feb 1st, 2018
**Today's Progress**: 3 hours of studying today - More JS played around in the console tried to do really simple variable assignments and then practice writing functions off of those, no more than two variables, and practiced with only string and number assignments. 
**Thoughts**:as an add on to yesterday- I named my alarms in my phone as arrays and then added into them the list of chores I would like to get done prior to the alarm cut off time, I tried to do this with correct syntax.

### Day 23: Jan 31st, 2018
**Today's Progress**: 4.5 hours of note taking and Free Code Camp challenges. I know that we're not supposed to count study time in the hour of code each day, but today I'm going to count it - see thoughts below. 
**Thoughts**:I watched a motivational video today about the 5 second rule (not the one where you've got this grace period to pick things off the ground like food) but the one that says you have to launch yourself into the things you want to do with premeditated intention so that your decisions become actions and your actions become future decisions, and then I realized I need to take a step back and reset with JavaScript. I think I've been approaching it with some major frusturations as I have these unrealistic expectations to be able to just do it or at least hack it together much like learning advanced CSS, however the difference is and this will sound like a pretty obvious statement, is that when I learned CSS it was one of the first languages I learned, so I was really diligent about writing everything down,all of the specs of each parameter and how that would eventually link to HTML, as well as working through every example I came along. So while I still have quite a bit to learn with CSS, I at least have a solid base that allows me to fumble around with things until I eventually figure it out. Like I said I kind of realize that I got away from this with learning Javascript. I've been telling myself things like I took algebra, I can skip the assigning variables portion. So today I spent the day taking detailed notes on all things Javascript. Every example/challenge in free code camp as well as a few chapters of Kyle simpsons intro to javascript in Pluralsight.

### Day 22: Jan 30th, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I edited more of my javascript today in codepen, although it still doesnt run, maybe I am closer to getting it to run though?  Tomorrow I plan to go through some really basic examples of Javascript and I'd also like to return to free code camp to continue progress there. 
**Thoughts**: is death by inability to learn Javascript a thing?(only kidding... kinda)

### Day 21: Jan 29th, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I finished watching a the second part of Kyle Simpsons Javascript for beginners talk on Pluralsight today and followed along in the console in google chrome as well as started playing some Code Combat to get more practice with Javascript. 
**Thoughts**: I feel like I'm really struggling with Javascript application. It's like I understand in premise what I'm supposed to do but the reality of execution is beyond weird to me. The coding games help.

### Day 20: Jan 28th, 2018
**Today's Progress**: worked on a tutorial called jsforcats and practiced making silly arrays in my browser of things that would never go together, and them adding them to made up functions of yellIt which switched each string into all caps and or makeMoreExciting which added five exclaimations on to the end of everything. I also edited the variables and assignments that I did yesterday in my webpage under the javascript section to what I believe to be accuate after doing the tutorial today. 
**Thoughts**: Javascript thus far has been difficult for me not so much because I can't understand what a variable or a string or an array is, but more so because it seems so abstract that I'm not quite sure where to start. I will say today felt like the deepest understanding and best application I have done of it thus far, and I think I've got more of a clear understanding on how to implement it in my form from my page yesterday. I have a feeling this Javascript road will be long and winding.

### Day 19: Jan 27th, 2018
**Today's Progress**: So I started a new Pen today with the intent to make a general information page and calculator for pet insurance, I thought it'd be good practice as I already understand our pet insurance plan and also already understand the variables invovled. 
**Thoughts**: same approach as the previous days, in regards to athestic, I did want everything to be responsive so I aimed for that. I did just start jotting down variables and where the input would come from in my javascript portion as well as the equations I would eventually these numbers to appear in the container I made below the form.

### Day 19: Jan 26th, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I worked more on my random div practice pen - thats what we'll call it for now. As a sidenote my pup is out of ER and finally home (yay!) so I sit here coding as she lays at my feet sleeping!  
**Thoughts**:  So my approach was similar to yesterday, in regards to all elements being responsive, I attempted a responsive div, which is in fact so, however not centered to the page how I would like just quite yet. I also discovered the transform, both rotate and translate tags today, and as well applied css hover to quite a few images. some individually through classes and others through the id.

### Day 18: Jan 25th, 2018
**Today's Progress**: So off the cuff I did some random div practice focusing mainly on vertical alignment and did my first video embed today. It's a silly video and for the sake of transparency for anyone wondering why i'd fill a page with just images of dogs -ill put it out there that the images I used for the mock site are all images of huskies as I found out today that my husky has Addisons disease. 
**Thoughts**: So my main focus was just code and see where I get in an hour. My work for that hour is in the codepen link below, and my secondary focus was to make everything responsive without the use of bootstrap. I think I did pretty good.

### Day 17: Jan 24th, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Studied up on Javascript today in Pluralsight, and as well did a little css practice with shapes and div. 
**Thoughts**: In hindsight I probably won't make another repeating pattern for shapes practice as it was a little difficult to see where my break was in the viewport but after manually counting where I was at, the div did flex correctly to drop items down as the viewport got smaller- therefore making less columns and more rows. Silverlining- I think the pen I made today will be a great practice to begin application for Javascript.

### Day 16: Jan 23rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished my porfolio today with a responsive contact form in my footer. I also spent quite some time on github just learning the lay of the land and committed not one but two contributions! Lastly and probably on par with level of excitment for my two github contributions - I STARTED JAVASCRIPT TODAY!(in Free Code Camp)
**Thoughts**: Contributing to open source is scary! But if there is anything I've learned thus far about web development and or open source contributing from all of the articles I've read and podcasts I've listened to is that you just gotta do it. Pick somewhere and start. SO - that being said, I contribute a book list annnd fixed typos in a READ ME -some real coding knowledge application ;D like I said, gotta start somewhere.

### Day 15: Jan 22nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio again today!
**Thoughts**: I did a lot of tinkering today. Worked on a text overlay for my header image. Also tinkered with overflow quite a bit as my columns weren't particularily stacking neatly. Added a couple of headers as well and some color :) and found a solution to getting my navigation bar responsive as to match the rest of the site!

### Day 14: Jan 21st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on porftfolio project.
**Thoughts**: more re-arranging code today, l'll need to spend some time looking at break points tomorrow, as I don't love the way things are stacking as well my margins are off only slightly with the background pictures as well as the foreground images. It's not bad if my viewport only shows so many but in the spirit of true responsiveness. I'd like the images to align no matter what.  I also coded my navigation bar that links to various sections of the webpage through div ids which was an easy manuver that only invovled me swapping out the previous "row one and row two" div id's that I had as placeholders (whoop organization!)

### Day 13: Jan 20th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my porfolio project again today! 
**Thoughts**: a little re-arranging and knit picking today, But I think I'm on track to finish this project by the end of day Tuesday. I definitley will need to take a look at the responsiveness of the site, not so much if images are scaling but where things are stacking. As well I'll need to add in a navigation bar tomorrow  and I'd like to challenge myself to add at least some type of animation in.   

Still feeling great about my portfolio project asthetic.

### Day 12: Jan 19th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Feeling so great about my portfolio page, and so great about coding! 
**Thoughts**: So I changed all of my containers to fluid containers for responsiveness. I think I've really got the hang of this grid system. Also coded a fixed image as to mimic a parallax scroll- it's not the same thing, and I know that but visually it's pretty fantastic and a first for me (yay!!), that and I'm really digging it. Drawing my idea out yesterday old school style with pen and paper helped me immensely, as mentioned yesterday - and I did edit my post from yesterday to include my process - color blocking and creating generic row names like row one and row two helps soo much as well as the comments and text information placeholders like image with white text overlay here or thumnail of project here. I left off at the social media icons part of my portfolio but thus far everything else I've coded is 100% responsive and stacks wonderfully :D (DOUBLE YAY!) 

Maybe its the coffee- Did I mention I'm feeling so optimistic about this porfolio project!

### Day 11: Jan 18th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Erased and restarted my portfolio page again today :) blocked everything out and also made sure to put some detailed notes/comments in as to what was what - this really helps me with div end tags and kind of just to keep track, I also color coded/blocked as so all large images or blocks of content are green, images red, text blue. etc. 
**Thoughts**: So I figured out what was happening with bootstrap. Turns out in codepen you need to enable bootstrap per new pen you begin. As I was looking at the new pen I had seen recently added and seen both boostrap 3 and 4 listed, so I assumed they were enabled. They were not. :| Although silver lining swallowing that silly mistake, did 1) get me familiar with the bootstrap grid system, and 2)is much easier to digest than the idea of me not understanding bootstrap. Whomp whomp whomp. 

So today I made a boostrap layout of my personal portfolio project that I will now begin to insert information into. YAY! - I also did some boostrap grid practice.

**Today's Progress**: Began my personal portfolio page today- Hooray! 
**Thoughts**: oh the endless ideas! - spending the rest of my day getting more familiar with bootstrap grids- I havent given up on this! Running into snags getting my columns to float so for example:

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">col-md-4</div>
    <div class="col-md-8">col-md-8</div>
         </div>
  </div>
codepen has both col-md-4 as well as col-md-8 display as each their own row versus floating together in one row. My CSS has both their height the same and no obstructing attributes like specific widths. erg.

### Day 9: Jan 16th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished with my Tribute page!! While I think I could go another 18 years of trying things out, it is sufficient for what I envisioned. 
**Thoughts**: I actually ended up removing alot of my CSS/ Erased and rewrote quite a bit of code. As well I decided not to work with the bootstrap grid as I was running into so many snags there. My tribute page is not near as responsive as I would like it to be however I did format the layout with percentages and as well tried to make sure all widths were the same in regards to imagimg as to provide a clean vertical line. 

I need more work with div and layouts. I'll be practicing this as well as continuing to build up my bootstrap grid skills in the next few days.

### Day 8: Jan 15th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: So I definitely am not done with my tribute page, but I did get quite a bit more practice today with bootstrap! My hour of code went as follows: type code, run code, erase code:repeat. 
**Thoughts**: Still frustruated with alignment and layout as it's not quite what I want. I know I'm being knit-picky buuuut  errrggg.

### Day 7: Jan 14th,2018

**Today's Progress**: My Tribute page is looking much more like what I picture in my mind! I took some time to go over a module in pluralsight today prior to working on the page, I think my understanding of the Bootstrap grid is much more concrete than in prior days and that alone helped to negate a lot of frustration with alignment and layout. 
**Thoughts** Again- still feeling like I need more time with Bootstrap, although I will say that I am enjoying what I have so far been able to learn and put to practice. Also I know that I am still overcomplicating things. I ran into a snag that took me almost 45 minutes wrap my head around- getting my header image to fill the width of the .container-fluid. My solution came through trial and error and re-running my code (erg) It's still not what I want it to be, but I think the rest of the space may be due to flow as I do not have any content yet in my aside column? I'll be taking this question to the 100 days slack board as I'm stumped. Anyways the closest I got to seeing the visual result of what I imagined was by removing a lot of my CSS. Like I said Im overcomplicating. So, the Tribute page did not get finished today, but it's about the progress right?

**Today's Progress**: Did some more work today on my Tribute page, about an hour and a half....Hey its Saturday :)

**Thoughts** I still feel I need to gain more familiarity with Bootstrap, Im still struggling with dimmensioning especially for grids written with HTML and CSS. I did refer to gridbyexample.com which I find to be a fantastic resource, but I am still running into snags. I am hoping to finailze my tribute page tomorrow.

### Day 5: Jan 12th,2018

**Today's Progress**: I could have sworn I updated this yesterday- maybe I forgot to commit changes? Anywho, Began my Tribute page for FCC through Codepen. Ran into a lot of snags in overanalyzing whether or not to use Bootstrap or to use HTML and CSS especially in the Grid area. 

**Thoughts** I need more Bootstrap practice!! I feel like I'm really overcomplicating things with trying to mix CSS as well as Bootstrap. I also need to revisit the natural flow of a webpage.

### Day 4: Jan 11th,2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the remaining Bootstrap challenges on Freecode Camp as well as the JQuery challenges ending at challenge number 110 in my map. 

**Thoughts** Im currently really loving web development! While it has its ups and downs as with anything, I feel that I've learned more in the past 3 months than in my last year, and while I had intended to learn Javascript prior to taking on anything else the freecode camp map took me elsewhere (totally not a bad thing). Confident wouldn't be the word I would use to describe my knowledge base of JQuery, as similar to my feelings towards Bootstrap, It also wasn't as scary as I thought it'd be but I do feel like I need a lot more practice and exposure to functions- Off to study some more!

### Day 3: Jan 10th,2018

**Today's Progress**: I completed about 20 bootstrap challenges today through free code camp. Wasn't I just saying that I needed more practice with forms and buttons?

**Thoughts** So turns out Bootstrap is not so scary. As well my past two days of "thoughts comments" seem a little silly in hindsight, but probably not as silly as the idea that I wasn't planning on putting too much effort into learning frameworks ... which I will openly admit that I didn't realize thats what bootstrap was. Furthermore, I heard on a coding podcast not so long ago an opinionated guy talk about the overuse of frameworks in the coding community and had decided that I would not be learning them as I strive to learn the "real" way of doing things. Anyways my point is, It was small potatoes in comparsion to teaching myself viewport units, and now I have the knowledge of manually coding a responsive website ( I mean to the extent that I will get with html and css) and now I've been exposed to the quick way. ie. bootstrap.  Zig zagged learning is a real thing, especially when you're self taught.

### Day 2: Jan 9th,2018

**Today's Progress**: 40 coding challenges in 1 hour! Although it is html5 and CSS both languges that I have learned over the past 6 months I am feeling pretty good about it and will consider it a win! 

**Thoughts** I need to practice forms. I realized the bulk of my studying so far has been pretty basic tags for html and as well a lot of work with div, and furthermore formatting to the viewport in regards to styling with CSS. When I came across tags for forms such as radio buttons and form actions this was a bit unfamiliar to me. Ended on challenge number 61. So begins bootstrap challenges tomorrow, eek! scary as I have not previewed bootstrap so far however,I guess I've gotta start somewhere.

### Day 1: Jan 8th,2018

**Today's Progress**: I started Javascript today, and coded my first ever script "Hello World" as an alert on one of my practice sites I had coded locally in the past via Adobe Brackets. I also completed html5 and CSS challenges in freecodecamp. Although I already have prior self taught knowledge of html5 as well as CSS, I figured it best to complete the challenges in free code camp anyways in the case that theres some new information in there for me. I plan to work ahead as so that my 100 days of code challenge more accurately represents my knowledge base (meaning what will be reflected in this log will soon be more coding challenges for Javascript and eventually Jquery as these two languages are what I am currently learning) 

**Thoughts** Its my first day of Javascript coding.Simple and beginner as it may be I ran my first script it, and it worked! I also spent a total of 5 hours studying specifically Javascript today. Ended on challenge number 21.
