# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 8th,2018

**Today's Progress**: I started Javascript today, and coded my first ever script "Hello World" as an alert on one of my practice sites I had coded locally in the past via Adobe Brackets. I also completed html5 and CSS challenges in freecodecamp. Although I already have prior self taught knowledge of html5 as well as CSS, I figured it best to complete the challenges in free code camp anyways in the case that theres some new information in there for me. I plan to work ahead as so that my 100 days of code challenge more accurately represents my knowledge base (meaning what will be reflected in this log will soon be more coding challenges for Javascript and eventually Jquery as these two languages are what I am currently learning) 

**Thoughts** Its my first day of Javascript coding.Simple and beginner as it may be I ran my first script it, and it worked! I also spent a total of 5 hours studying specifically Javascript today.
