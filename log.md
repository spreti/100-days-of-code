# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 3: Jan 10th,2018

**Today's Progress**: I completed about 20 bootstrap challenges today through free code camp. Wasn't I just saying that I needed more practice with forms and buttons?

**Thoughts** So turns out Bootstrap is not so scary. As well my past two days of "thoughts comments" seem a little silly in hindsight, but probably not as silly as the idea that I wasn't planning on putting too much effort into learning frameworks ... which I will openly admit that I didn't realize thats what bootstrap was. Furthermore, I heard on a coding podcast not so long ago an opinionated guy talk about the overuse of frameworks in the coding community and had decided that I would not be learning them as I strive to learn the "real" way of doing things. Anyways my point is, It was small potatoes in comparsion to teaching myself viewport units, and now I have the knowledge of manually coding a responsive website ( I mean to the extent that I will get with html and css) and now I've been exposed to the quick way. ie. bootstrap.  Zig zagged learning is a real thing, especially when you're self taught.

### Day 2: Jan 9th,2018

**Today's Progress**: 40 coding challenges in 1 hour! Although it is html5 and CSS both languges that I have learned over the past 6 months I am feeling pretty good about it and will consider it a win! 

**Thoughts** I need to practice forms. I realized the bulk of my studying so far has been pretty basic tags for html and as well a lot of work with div, and furthermore formatting to the viewport in regards to styling with CSS. When I came across tags for forms such as radio buttons and form actions this was a bit unfamiliar to me. Ended on challenge number 61. So begins bootstrap challenges tomorrow, eek! scary as I have not previewed bootstrap so far however,I guess I've gotta start somewhere.

### Day 1: Jan 8th,2018

**Today's Progress**: I started Javascript today, and coded my first ever script "Hello World" as an alert on one of my practice sites I had coded locally in the past via Adobe Brackets. I also completed html5 and CSS challenges in freecodecamp. Although I already have prior self taught knowledge of html5 as well as CSS, I figured it best to complete the challenges in free code camp anyways in the case that theres some new information in there for me. I plan to work ahead as so that my 100 days of code challenge more accurately represents my knowledge base (meaning what will be reflected in this log will soon be more coding challenges for Javascript and eventually Jquery as these two languages are what I am currently learning) 

**Thoughts** Its my first day of Javascript coding.Simple and beginner as it may be I ran my first script it, and it worked! I also spent a total of 5 hours studying specifically Javascript today. Ended on challenge number 21.
